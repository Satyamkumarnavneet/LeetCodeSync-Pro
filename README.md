# LeetCodeSync Pro - Sync your LeetCode Solutions with GitHub

## What is LeetHub-3.0?

LeetCodeSync Pro is a powerful tool that automates the synchronization of your LeetCode coding solutions with GitHub repositories. Say goodbye to manual syncing and hello to more time for coding and innovation. Forked from a renowned predecessor, LeetCodeSync Pro is designed to streamline your coding workflow.


## Why LeetCodeSync Pro?

Tired of juggling between LeetCode and GitHub to manage your coding solutions? LeetCodeSync Pro provides a seamless solution by automatically pushing your code to GitHub when you pass all tests on a LeetCode problem. Spend more time solving problems and less time on manual tasks.
